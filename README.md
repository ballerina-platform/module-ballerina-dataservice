## Overview

The `ballerina/dataservice` package supports data services that `bal persist` generates from a persist model. A data service exposes the entities of the model over a protocol such as HTTP, with no hand-written service code.

The design is in the [data service proposal](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-spec/issues/1503).
