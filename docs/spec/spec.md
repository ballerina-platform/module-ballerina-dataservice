## Introduction

This is the specification for the `ballerina/dataservice` package of the [Ballerina language](https://ballerina.io/).
The package supports the data services that `bal persist` generates from a persist model, as defined in the
[data service proposal](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-spec/issues/1503). It holds the annotation
that selects what a data service exposes, and the protocol-neutral runtime that generated services call: the error
body and codes, the mapping from persist errors to them, and the value conversions every protocol shares. Each
protocol has its own package, such as `ballerina/dataservice.http`.

The conforming implementation of the specification is released and included in the distribution. Any deviation from
the specification is considered a bug.

## 1. The `Expose` annotation

```ballerina
public enum Operation {
    READ = "read",
    CREATE = "create",
    UPDATE = "update",
    DELETE = "delete"
}

public type ExposeConfig record {|
    [Operation, Operation...] operations = [READ, CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE];
|};

public const annotation ExposeConfig Expose on source type;
```

An entity of a persist model is exposed by a data service only when its record type has the `@dataservice:Expose`
annotation. The entity then allows the actions in `operations`, which are every action by default.

| Annotation | Exposed | Actions |
|---|---|---|
| none | no | — |
| `@dataservice:Expose` | yes | `read`, `create`, `update`, `delete` |
| `@dataservice:Expose {operations: [dataservice:READ, dataservice:UPDATE]}` | yes | `read`, `update` |

Each action enables these operations:

| Action | Operations |
|---|---|
| `read` | Get many, get one |
| `create` | Create one, create many |
| `update` | Patch one |
| `delete` | Delete one |

`Expose` is a constant annotation. Its value is evaluated at compile time and is not kept at runtime. The type of
`operations` requires at least one operation, so an empty list is a compile error. An operation is written as an
`Operation` member, such as `dataservice:READ`, or as its string value, such as `"read"`.

Whether a data service is generated is decided by `options.dataservice` in the `[[tool.persist]]` entry of
`Ballerina.toml`. The annotations only select what the service exposes.

## 2. Errors

### 2.1. The error body

```ballerina
public enum ErrorCode {
    NOT_FOUND,
    CONFLICT,
    CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION,
    INVALID_INPUT,
    INTERNAL
}

public type DataserviceError record {|
    ErrorCode code;
    string message;
|};
```

A data service error falls into one of these categories. Each protocol package maps a category to its own form, such
as an HTTP status code.

| Category | `code` | Raised when | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Not found | `NOT_FOUND` | No record has the given key | `persist:NotFoundError` |
| Conflict | `CONFLICT` | A record with the key or a unique value already exists | `persist:AlreadyExistsError` |
| Constraint violation | `CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION` | A write violates a foreign key | `persist:ConstraintViolationError` |
| Invalid input | `INVALID_INPUT` | The input cannot be bound to the operation's type, or a value is not in its format | The protocol module's binding error, or a [`ConversionError`](#3-value-conversions) |
| Internal | `INTERNAL` | Any other failure | `persist:Error` and others |

### 2.2. Mapping persist errors

```ballerina
public type KeyValue int|string|float|decimal|boolean;

public isolated function toDataserviceError(error err, string entity = "", KeyValue[] key = [])
        returns DataserviceError;
```

`toDataserviceError` maps an error that the persist client returned to the error body. `entity` is the entity's
name and `key` holds the values of the record's key fields, in key order. The message is written by this function, not
taken from the error, because the SQL datastores put driver text, such as table and constraint names, in their error
messages:

| Error | `code` | `message` |
|---|---|---|
| `persist:NotFoundError` | `NOT_FOUND` | `A record with the key '<key>' does not exist for the entity '<Entity>'.` |
| `persist:AlreadyExistsError` | `CONFLICT` | `A record that conflicts with an existing record of the entity '<Entity>' already exists.` |
| `persist:ConstraintViolationError` | `CONSTRAINT_VIOLATION` | `The operation violates a constraint of the entity '<Entity>'.` |
| Any other error | `INTERNAL` | `An internal error occurred.` |

`<key>` is each key value written with `toString`, joined by `/` in key order, so the composite key `["P1", 1]` is
written `P1/1`, `1.5` stays `1.5`, and a `decimal` keeps its scale.

For a constraint violation and an internal error, the function logs the error, with the entity's name, at the `ERROR`
level. The error's own message is not returned to the caller.

## 3. Value conversions

The JSON form that Ballerina gives `byte[]` and the `time:*` record types does not suit a client: `time:Utc` is a tuple,
the other `time:*` types are records, and `byte[]` is an array of numbers. A protocol that sends these values as JSON
uses the following functions, so that every protocol uses the same formats.

```ballerina
public type ConversionErrorDetail record {|
    string format;
|};

public type ConversionError distinct error<ConversionErrorDetail>;
```

| Type | To string | From string | Format | `format` in `ConversionError` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `byte[]` | `bytesToString` | `bytesFromString` | Base64, RFC 4648 standard alphabet, padded | `a base64 string` |
| `time:Date` | `dateToString` | `dateFromString` | `2024-01-02` | `an ISO 8601 date` |
| `time:TimeOfDay` | `timeOfDayToString` | `timeOfDayFromString` | `10:15:30` or `10:15:30.5` | `an ISO 8601 time` |
| `time:Civil` | `civilToString` | `civilFromString` | `2024-01-02T10:15:30`, without an offset | `an ISO 8601 date-time` |
| `time:Utc` | `utcToString` | `utcFromString` | `2024-01-02T10:15:30Z` | `an ISO 8601 date-time` |

Each `<type>ToString` function takes a value of the type and returns its string form. Each `<type>FromString` function
takes a string and returns a value of the type, or a `ConversionError` whose message is `The value is not <format>.`
and whose detail holds the format.

- **`byte[]`:** the string must use the standard alphabet and padding. An unpadded string is a `ConversionError`.
- **`time:Date`:** written as `YYYY-MM-DD`. The string must be a valid calendar date.
- **`time:TimeOfDay`:** written as `HH:MM:SS`, followed by the fraction of a second only when it is not zero. A missing
  `second` is written as `00`. The string must be `HH:MM:SS` with an optional fraction; `HH:MM` alone is a
  `ConversionError`.
- **`time:Civil`:** the date and the time joined by `T`. An offset in the value is not written. A string with an
  offset, including `Z`, is a `ConversionError`.
- **`time:Utc`:** written with `time:utcToString`. A string with the offset `Z` or `+hh:mm` is accepted and converted
  to UTC, as `time:utcFromString` does.

## 4. Compiler plugin

A persist model is not compiled with its package: `bal build` reads it through the persist tool, and the compiler sees
it only when the file is compiled on its own, as the IDE does. The compiler plugin validates the annotations of such a
file, and the persist tool repeats the same checks every time it generates a data service.

The plugin acts only on a single-file project whose file is in a package's `persist` directory, `persist/<file>`, or
in a named model's directory, `persist/<model>/<file>`, where the directory above `persist` holds `Ballerina.toml`.
It does nothing in any other source.

| Check | Reported by | Message |
|---|---|---|
| `@dataservice:Expose` is on a record type | The plugin, `DATASERVICE_101` | `the @dataservice:Expose annotation is allowed only on a record type in the persist model.` |
| `operations` is non-empty and has only `Operation` values | The compiler, through the type of `operations` | The compiler's type error |
| `operations` has no duplicates | The plugin, `DATASERVICE_102` | `duplicate operation '<value>' in the @dataservice:Expose annotation of the entity '<Entity>'.` |

`<value>` is the repeated operation as it is written, such as `dataservice:READ` or `"read"`. An operation written
as a member and as its string value is a duplicate. Each repeat is reported.
